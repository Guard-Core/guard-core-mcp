## Project Overview

Guard Core MCP is an MCP server that answers Guard-ecosystem questions from the **libraries actually installed in the interpreter running it**, not from model memory. It provides config validation, config-field lookup, docs search, live threat detection, and ecosystem-wide setup guidance (engines, adapters and agents across Go, TypeScript, PHP, Rust and Python) for the Guard security libraries.

- **PyPI Package**: `guard-core-mcp`
- **Import Name**: `guard_core_mcp`
- **Console Script**: `guard-core-mcp` (runs `guard_core_mcp.server:main`, stdio transport)
- **Python Support**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- **Package Manager**: uv
- **Build System**: Docker + Make

That is why the README pushes `uv add --dev guard-core-mcp` over `uvx`: an isolated environment has no Guard libraries to introspect, so `uvx guard-core-mcp` starts but can only answer from bundled documentation.

## Covered Libraries

`PACKAGE_MODELS` (in `guard_core_mcp/config.py`) is the allowlist of packages the server can introspect. Current entries:

| Package | Introspected module | Model class |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| `guard-core` | `guard_core` | `SecurityConfig` |
| `fastapi-guard` | `guard` | `SecurityConfig` |
| `guard-agent` | `guard_agent` | `AgentConfig` |

Supporting another package means adding an entry to that dict. The dynamic `importlib.import_module` is safe precisely because it is constrained to this allowlist (hence the `# nosemgrep` on the import line).

## Tools

Each tool is a thin `@mcp.tool()` wrapper in `server.py` around a module function; it converts `ModuleNotFoundError` into `missing_library_error()`'s `{"error", "hint"}` dict. Tools return error dicts; they do not raise. The docstring on each tool is the model-facing contract and carries the caveats (for example, `check_payload` documents that it runs the detection stage only, not the whole middleware pipeline).

| Tool | Signature | What it does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `versions` | `versions()` | Reports `installed` versions (live introspection), `docs_bundled_for` (vendored snapshot) and `knowledge_bundled_for` (hand-written corpus) so a caller can detect skew before trusting a docs answer |
| `validate_config` | `validate_config(config, package)` | Validates a config dict against the installed Pydantic model; reports *unknown* keys with `difflib` suggestions (pydantic silently drops them) and captures `DeprecationWarning`s (`_retry_without_rejected_fields` re-validates remaining valid fields so one type error does not hide the rest) |
| `config_fields` | `config_fields(query, package="fastapi-guard")` | Field lookup over the installed model's schema |
| `search_docs` | `search_docs(...)` | Token-count search over the vendored docs corpus and the hand-written knowledge corpus |
| `get_doc` | `get_doc(package, path)` | Returns a vendored doc or knowledge entry; guards traversal via `resolve()` + `is_relative_to` |
| `check_payload` | `check_payload(payload, config)` (async) | Runs guard-core's real detection engine against a payload via `_SyntheticRequest` |
| `ecosystem` | `ecosystem()` | Returns the full registry matrix: five languages, each with engine, adapters (verified snippets, Python counterparts) and agent, plus the spec-4.0.2 conformance block and the SaaS ingestion contract |
| `adapter_setup` | `adapter_setup(language, framework)` | Install command plus a verified minimal middleware integration for one adapter, with its engine's install and conformance status |
| `wire_agent` | `wire_agent(language, framework=None)` | Telemetry agent setup for a language: install, snippet, buffer/flush/overflow/retry semantics, the ingestion contract, and a per-adapter integration note |

## Architecture

Two independent answer sources, and the distinction drives most of the design:

- **Live introspection** (`config.py`, `detection.py`) reads the installed pydantic models and calls guard-core's real detection engine. Accurate for whatever version is installed; unavailable if the library is not.
- **Vendored docs snapshot** (`docs.py` + `guard_core_mcp/_docs/`) ships with the package and always works, but is pinned to whatever version was last synced.
- **Registry and knowledge corpus** (`ecosystem.py` + `guard_core_mcp/_knowledge/`) are static typed data and hand-written markdown; they cover the half of the ecosystem that has no installable Python package to introspect.

**`config.py` and `PACKAGE_MODELS`.** The dict maps package name to `(import module, model class)`. `validate_config` earns its keep by reporting unknown keys with `difflib` suggestions and by capturing deprecation warnings.

**`detection.py` and `_SyntheticRequest`.** That class structurally implements guard-core's `GuardRequest` protocol (no inheritance). If upstream adds a protocol member, this class must gain it or mypy fails on the `request: GuardRequest` assignment. `enable_redis` is forced to `False` so the sandbox never touches Redis, regardless of the caller's config.

**`ecosystem.py` is the ecosystem registry.** Pydantic models (`EcosystemRegistry`, `LanguageEntry`, `EngineInfo`, `AdapterInfo`, `AgentInfo`, `ConformanceInfo`, `SaaSContract`) hold the whole family as data: per language the engine, its four adapters with snippets copied verbatim from the sibling repo READMEs, and the agent. It also pins the spec-4.0.2 conformance facts (163 cases, engine commit `886f8013`, 82/82 interop) and the guard-core-app ingestion contract. Facts here are verified against the sibling repos, never inferred: `release_status` distinguishes `published` from `tagged` from `untagged`, because several Go, PHP and Rust packages carry tags or version constants that registry publication has not caught up with. When a sibling repo moves, update this file by hand; `ecosystem`/`adapter_setup`/`wire_agent` read only from it, and `tests/test_ecosystem.py` asserts the verified versions and API names.

**`docs.py` serves two corpora.** `guard_core_mcp/_docs/` is generated output; never hand-edit it. `scripts/sync_docs.py` copies `*.md` and `*.mdx` from sibling clones at `../fastapi-guard`, `../guard-core`, `../guard-agent` and `../guard-core-ts` (the last one from its Astro docs subdirectory, `docs/src/content/docs`) and records each repo's version from `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` into `manifest.json`. `make sync-docs` and `make check-docs-drift` therefore require those clones next to this repo; CI's `docs-drift` job clones them itself and runs weekly on a timer, because upstream releases independently of this repo. `guard_core_mcp/_knowledge/` is the opposite: hand-written markdown for the repos that ship no docs site (the Go, PHP and Rust engines and agents, and the SaaS ingestion contract), one `index.md` per repo with its own `manifest.json` carrying the repo URL as the citation. Search is a naive per-line token count with no index; `get_doc` guards path traversal via `resolve()` + `is_relative_to`.

**`server.py` is a thin tool layer.** Keep new tools in that shape, and keep the real logic in the module rather than the tool body.

**`hosting.py` serves the same tools over streamable-http.** `create_hosted_app` wraps `mcp.streamable_http_app()` (stateless) in a pure-ASGI bearer-auth middleware that verifies RS256 tokens via `PyJWKClient` (URL mode) or an inline JWKS (tests, air-gapped), plus an RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata route and CORS. The hosted deployment is an OAuth 2.1 resource server only: the authorization server lives in guard-core-app (`api.guard-core.com`), configuration comes from the `GUARD_CORE_MCP_*` environment variables documented in `docs/chatgpt-plugin.md`, and `guard-core-mcp-http` is its entry point. The `hosted` extra installs the Guard libraries so the hosted `versions`/`validate_config`/`check_payload` answers reflect the lockfile-pinned latest releases; the stdio local install stays untouched. `plugin/` is the ChatGPT directory submission package and is regenerated by hand, never by tooling.

## Quick Start

```bash
# In the project that has the Guard libraries installed:
uv add --dev guard-core-mcp
claude mcp add guard-core -- uv run guard-core-mcp
```

`uvx guard-core-mcp` will start, but an isolated environment contains no `guard-core` or `fastapi-guard` for it to introspect, so it can only answer from bundled documentation. Running it inside your own environment is what makes the answers match the versions you actually ship.

## Development Commands

Local (fast, what you want while iterating):

```bash
uv sync --extra dev                          # install
uv run pytest                                # full suite (coverage is in addopts)
uv run pytest -m "not e2e"                   # skip the stdio-subprocess tests
uv run pytest tests/test_config.py::test_name -v   # single test
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .
uv run mypy guard_core_mcp
uv run pre-commit run --all-files            # exactly what CI's pre-commit job runs
```

Makefile (note: `make test`, `make lint` and `make check-all` build and run a Docker image, then `docker system prune -f`; they are the release gates, not the inner loop):

```bash
make test            # default Python 3.10 in Docker; make test-3.11 ... test-3.14
make lint            # ruff + mypy in Docker
make fix             # auto-fix with ruff
make check-all       # lint + security + quality + analysis
make sync-docs       # regenerate guard_core_mcp/_docs from sibling repo clones
make check-docs-drift
make serve-docs      # serve the published MkDocs site locally
make lint-docs       # pymarkdownlnt over the markdown outside the package
make fix-docs
make bump-version VERSION=x.y.z
```

## Testing Guidelines

- pytest runs `asyncio_mode = "auto"`, so async tests need no marker
- The `e2e` marker means the test spawns a real server subprocess over the MCP stdio transport; skip locally with `uv run pytest -m "not e2e"`
- Suite layout: `test_config.py`, `test_detection.py`, `test_docs.py`, `test_ecosystem.py`, `test_server.py`, `test_e2e.py`, `test_sync_docs.py`, `test_sync_docs_script.py`
- Coverage is configured in `addopts`; the Docker `make test` gates releases

### Constraints worth knowing before you edit

- **`mcp>=2` is a hard pin.** The server imports `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`, which does not exist in mcp 1.x, so a blanket `uv lock --upgrade` that downgrades mcp breaks the server at import. Semgrep pins `mcp==1.23.3`, so it runs via `uvx --from semgrep` rather than as a dev dependency.
- **Complexity ceilings are enforced**, not advisory: xenon `--max-absolute B --max-modules A --max-average A`, plus vulture at `min_confidence = 100`, deptry, and strict mypy (`disallow_untyped_defs`, `warn_unreachable`, and friends). This is why the modules are built from small helpers.
- `.roboco/conventions.yml` blocks lint suppressions and warns on inline comments.
- The version string lives in `pyproject.toml`, `guard_core_mcp/__init__.py`, `.mike.yml`, `docs/versions/versions.json`, `docs/index.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/release-notes.md`. Use `make bump-version VERSION=x.y.z` rather than editing by hand.
- `docs/` is the published MkDocs site for this project; `guard_core_mcp/_docs/` is the vendored upstream corpus the server serves. Different things, easy to confuse.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use uv** for package management
2. **Keep tools thin**: logic lives in `config.py` / `detection.py` / `docs.py`, never in the tool body; error dicts, not raises
3. **Never hand-edit `guard_core_mcp/_docs/`**: change upstream repos and run `make sync-docs`
4. **Run the full suite before claiming green**; the e2e stdio tests catch wiring the unit tests cannot
5. **Do not downgrade `mcp`** below 2; check `uv.lock` after upgrades
6. **Keep the tool docstrings current**: they are the model-facing contract
7. **Use `make bump-version`** for version changes; the string lives in seven places
