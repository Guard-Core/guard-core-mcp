Tools
=====

All nine tools are registered in `guard_core_mcp/server.py`. `validate_config`, `config_fields`, `search_docs` and `get_doc` all accept a `package` argument that should be one of `fastapi-guard`, `guard-core` or `guard-agent` (the docs tools also know the bundled `guard-core-ts` corpus and the `guard-core-app`, `guard-core-go`, `guard-core-php`, `guard-core-rs`, `guard-agent-go`, `guard-agent-ts`, `guard-agent-rs` and `guard-agent-php` knowledge entries), but they don't validate it the same way. `validate_config` and `config_fields` reject an unrecognized value with `{"error": "unknown package '<value>'; expected one of guard-core, fastapi-guard, guard-agent"}`. `search_docs` has no such check, an unrecognized `package` just matches nothing, so it returns `{"query": ..., "results": []}`. `get_doc` returns `{"error": "unknown doc path"}` for either an unrecognized `package` or a `path` that doesn't exist under it, the two cases aren't distinguished in the response.

`validate_config`, `config_fields` and `check_payload` depend on the corresponding library being installed in the interpreter running the server. If it is not, they return a structured `{"error": ..., "hint": ...}` instead of raising, see [Installation](installation.md#why-not-uvx-guard-core-mcp) for exactly what that looks like and why. The three ecosystem tools (`ecosystem`, `adapter_setup`, `wire_agent`) are pure data served from the registry in `guard_core_mcp/ecosystem.py` and work in any environment, with or without the Guard libraries installed.

___

`versions`
----------

```python
def versions() -> dict[str, Any]
```

No parameters. Reports which Guard libraries this server can introspect, at what version, and which library versions the bundled documentation and knowledge corpora cover. A `null` installed version means that library is absent from this interpreter, so any answer about it would be a guess rather than introspection.

**Example call**:

```python
versions()
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "guard_core_mcp": "1.3.0",
  "installed": {
    "guard-core": "4.2.0",
    "fastapi-guard": "8.0.2",
    "guard-agent": "3.1.0"
  },
  "docs_bundled_for": {
    "fastapi-guard": "8.0.2",
    "guard-agent": "3.1.0",
    "guard-core": "4.2.0",
    "guard-core-ts": "4.2.0"
  },
  "knowledge_bundled_for": {
    "guard-core-app": "2026.09.24",
    "guard-core-go": "4.2.0",
    "guard-core-php": "4.2.0",
    "guard-core-rs": "4.2.0",
    "guard-agent-go": "3.1.0",
    "guard-agent-php": "3.1.0",
    "guard-agent-rs": "3.1.0",
    "guard-agent-ts": "3.1.0"
  }
}
```

The two sides agree above because this release vendored its docs from those same versions, but they are independent and often will not: `installed` reflects this project's actual dependencies, while `docs_bundled_for` is fixed at build time to whatever `scripts/sync_docs.py` last vendored. Either side trailing the other is the normal case, not a fault. A `null` under `installed` is the real warning sign, a version that merely differs from `docs_bundled_for` is not. See [Installation](installation.md#verifying-the-install) for the full explanation.

___

`validate_config`
------------------

```python
def validate_config(config: dict[str, Any], package: str = "fastapi-guard") -> dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config` | `dict[str, Any]` | required | The config dict to validate |
| `package` | `str` | `"fastapi-guard"` | One of `fastapi-guard`, `guard-core`, `guard-agent` |

Validates `config` against the installed library's real Pydantic model (`SecurityConfig` for `fastapi-guard`/`guard-core`, `AgentConfig` for `guard-agent`) and reports four separate kinds of problems: unknown keys pydantic would otherwise silently ignore (with typo suggestions), validation errors, `DeprecationWarning`s the model raises for fields that still work but shouldn't be used, and, under `construction_warnings`, guard-core's own `logger.warning` signals for construction-time misconfigurations it does not raise on: an unknown constructor keyword, a `trusted_proxies` `/0` network, a `whitelist` `/0` network, and an empty `enabled_detection_categories` with detection enabled.

**A deprecated field**: as of guard-core 3.17.0, no `SecurityConfig` field is deprecated, so `deprecated` is `[]` for any valid config today. The shape is unchanged from before; a future deprecation would appear as an entry with the field's name and the model's own `DeprecationWarning` message, for example:

```json
{
  "field": "some_field",
  "message": "some_field is deprecated and will be removed in a future release; ..."
}
```

**Example call, a typo'd field**:

```python
validate_config({"rate_limit": 100, "enable_rate_limit": True}, "fastapi-guard")
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "package": "fastapi-guard",
  "version": "7.8.2",
  "model": "SecurityConfig",
  "errors": [],
  "unknown_fields": [
    {
      "name": "enable_rate_limit",
      "did_you_mean": ["enable_rate_limiting", "enable_rate_limit_auto_ban"]
    }
  ],
  "deprecated": [],
  "construction_warnings": [
    "SecurityConfig received unknown field 'enable_rate_limit'; it was ignored and had no effect. Did you mean 'enable_rate_limiting'?"
  ]
}
```

`enable_rate_limit` isn't a `SecurityConfig` field, the real one is `enable_rate_limiting`, and Pydantic would have accepted and then ignored it silently, which is why the same problem also shows up in `construction_warnings`: guard-core logs it as a `logger.warning` on construction. A type error (for example `{"rate_limit": "not-a-number"}`) instead produces an entry in `errors`, each with `field`, `message`, and the offending `input`.

___

`config_fields`
----------------

```python
def config_fields(query: str, package: str = "fastapi-guard") -> dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `str` | required | An exact field name, or free text to match against field names and descriptions |
| `package` | `str` | `"fastapi-guard"` | One of `fastapi-guard`, `guard-core`, `guard-agent` |

An exact field name populates `exact` with that field's type, default, required-ness and description. Every query, exact or not, is also matched (case-insensitively, every token must appear) against every other field's name and description to populate `matches`; if that yields nothing and there was no exact hit either, `matches` falls back to the closest field names by fuzzy string distance.

**Example call**:

```python
config_fields("rate_limit", "fastapi-guard")
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "package": "fastapi-guard",
  "version": "7.8.2",
  "query": "rate_limit",
  "exact": {
    "name": "rate_limit",
    "type": "int",
    "default": "10",
    "required": false,
    "description": "Maximum requests per rate_limit_window"
  },
  "matches": [
    {
      "name": "threat_ban_config",
      "type": "mappingproxy[str, ThreatBanConfig]",
      "default": null,
      "required": false,
      "description": "Per-category ban thresholds and durations. Categories are the penetration-detection categories plus the pseudo-category 'rate_limit' (used only when enable_rate_limit_auto_ban is on). Unlisted categories fall back to auto_ban_threshold / auto_ban_duration."
    },
    {
      "name": "enable_rate_limit_auto_ban",
      "type": "bool",
      "default": "False",
      "required": false,
      "description": "Feed rate-limit violations into the same auto-ban engine used for penetration detection: each active-mode (non-passive) violation increments the 'rate_limit' category of the existing suspicious-count structure and runs the same threshold logic (threat_ban_config['rate_limit'] override first, then the flat auto_ban_threshold / auto_ban_duration). Requires enable_ip_banning to actually ban. Default off: zero behavior change unless enabled."
    },
    {
      "name": "rate_limit_window",
      "type": "int",
      "default": "60",
      "required": false,
      "description": "Rate limiting time window (seconds)"
    },
    {
      "name": "enable_rate_limiting",
      "type": "bool",
      "default": "True",
      "required": false,
      "description": "Enable/disable rate limiting functionality"
    },
    {
      "name": "endpoint_rate_limits",
      "type": "dict[str, tuple[int, int]]",
      "default": null,
      "required": false,
      "description": "Per-endpoint rate limits set by dynamic rules"
    }
  ]
}
```

`matches` here still lists every other field whose name or description contains `rate_limit`, alongside the `exact` hit, which is how this doubles as "does a setting for X exist at all". A typo'd query with no token match at all, `"rate_limti"`, say, falls through to the fuzzy fallback instead, which is `matches` populated purely from `difflib.get_close_matches` against every field name, with `exact` still `null`.

___

`search_docs`
--------------

```python
def search_docs(query: str, package: str | None = None, limit: int = 5) -> dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `str` | required | Free-text search terms |
| `package` | `str \| None` | `None` | One of the packages above; omit to search everything |
| `limit` | `int` | `5` | Maximum number of results |

Searches both bundled corpora (`guard_core_mcp/_docs/` for the vendored MkDocs/Astro sites, `guard_core_mcp/_knowledge/` for the hand-written ecosystem entries) by counting query-term occurrences per page, and returns the highest-scoring pages with the best-matching heading and a snippet. Each result carries `url`, the citation URL for that page, built from the manifest recorded when the corpus was vendored, this works even when the underlying library isn't installed, since the corpora ship inside the wheel.

**Example call**:

```python
search_docs("rate limiting", "fastapi-guard", limit=3)
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "query": "rate limiting",
  "results": [
    {
      "package": "fastapi-guard",
      "path": "tutorial/decorators/rate-limiting.md",

  ]
}
```

`path` and `package` from a result feed directly into `get_doc`.

___

`get_doc`
---------

```python
def get_doc(package: str, path: str) -> dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package` | `str` | required | One of the packages `versions` reports under `docs_bundled_for` or `knowledge_bundled_for` |
| `path` | `str` | required | A relative path from a `search_docs` result, e.g. `installation.md` |

Returns the full text of one bundled documentation page. `path` is resolved relative to that package's vendored root and rejected, as `{"error": "unknown doc path"}`, if it would escape that root or doesn't exist, so this cannot be used to read arbitrary files.

**Example call**:

```python
get_doc("fastapi-guard", "installation.md")
```

**Example response** (content truncated here; the real response returns the full page)

```json
{
  "package": "fastapi-guard",
  "path": "installation.md",
  "url": "https://rennf93.github.io/fastapi-guard/latest/installation/",
  "content": "---\n\ntitle: Installation - FastAPI Guard\ndescription: Learn how to install and set up FastAPI Guard, a comprehensive security middleware for FastAPI applications\nkeywords: fastapi guard installation, python security middleware, fastapi security setup\n---\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstall `fastapi-..."
}
```

`check_payload`
----------------

```python
async def check_payload(
    path: str = "/",
    method: str = "GET",
    query: dict[str, str] | None = None,
    headers: dict[str, str] | None = None,
    body: str | dict[str, Any] | list[Any] | None = None,
    config: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | `str` | `"/"` | Request path |
| `method` | `str` | `"GET"` | HTTP method |
| `query` | `dict[str, str] \| None` | `None` | Query parameters |
| `headers` | `dict[str, str] \| None` | `None` | Request headers |
| `body` | `str \| dict \| list \| None` | `None` | Request body. A raw string is sent as-is; a JSON object or array is serialized for you |
| `config` | `dict[str, Any] \| None` | `None` | `SecurityConfig` fields to test how a setting changes the verdict |

The only async tool. Builds a synthetic request from the arguments and runs it through guard-core's real `detect_penetration_attempt`, using a `SecurityConfig` built from `config` (defaulting to guard-core's defaults) with `enable_redis` always forced to `False`, the sandbox never touches Redis, so results are Redis-independent by construction and a caller cannot re-enable it. `elapsed_ms` reflects actual detection time for that call and varies between runs; the values below are one real sample, not a promise. `headers` is matched case-insensitively, the same way guard-core's own `GuardRequest` protocol requires. A `config` value that fails `SecurityConfig` validation returns `{"error": "invalid config", "errors": [...]}`, with each entry in the same `field`/`message`/`input` shape `validate_config` reports for the identical failure.

guard-core 3.15.0 bounds the scan three ways: `detection_max_scan_values` caps the request values inspected (default 512, names and values counted), `detection_max_scan_chars` separately caps the total characters handed to the pattern engine across those values (default 65536), and a value that would start after either budget is spent is skipped, so a payload beyond either cap only gets a verdict on the scanned prefix. `detection_max_json_depth` (default 32) caps how deep a JSON body is walked structurally; a dict or list reached at that depth is serialized back to text and scanned as one value instead of being descended into further.

Since guard-core 3.15.0, `detect_penetration_attempt` also configures guard-core's detection singleton from the config it is given, the first time it runs or whenever the config object changes, instead of requiring the caller to configure it separately first. `check_payload` never configured that singleton itself, so before 3.15.0 it always ran guard-core's slower legacy pattern path rather than the enhanced path a real adapter runs, and could report a different verdict than a live request would. From 3.15.0 on, `check_payload`'s verdicts come from that same enhanced path, this is the first `guard-core-mcp` release where that is true.

!!! warning "This is the detection stage, not the whole pipeline"
    `check_payload` runs `detect_penetration_attempt` and nothing else. A real request
    also passes IP rules, rate limiting, user-agent, cloud-provider and route checks, any
    of which can block it before detection ever runs. In particular, guard-core skips
    detection entirely for a whitelisted IP, `suspicious_activity.check()` returns early
    when `request.state.is_whitelisted` is set, so an app with a `whitelist` configured
    will happily serve a payload this tool reports as a threat. Read a clean verdict as
    "the detection engine does not flag this", not "the request reaches your route".

**Example call, a SQL injection payload**:

```python
await check_payload(path="/search", method="GET", query={"q": "1' OR '1'='1"})
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "is_threat": true,
  "trigger_info": "Query param 'q': Value matched pattern '(?i)(?:OR|AND)\\s+(?:'[\\w\\d]*'='[\\w\\d]*'?|[@:$][A-Za-z_]\\w*\\s*=\\s*[@:$][A-Za-z_]\\w*)'",
  "threat_categories": ["sqli"],
  "threat_scores": {"sqli": 1.0},
  "elapsed_ms": 9.92
}
```

**Example call, a benign request**:

```python
await check_payload(path="/search", method="GET", query={"q": "hello world"})
```

**Example response**:

```json
{
  "is_threat": false,
  "trigger_info": "",
  "threat_categories": [],
  "threat_scores": {},
  "elapsed_ms": 2.72
}
```
