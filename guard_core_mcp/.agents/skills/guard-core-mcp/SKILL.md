description: guard-core-mcp, the MCP server for the Guard ecosystem. Use when validating SecurityConfig or AgentConfig dicts before shipping them (unknown-key detection with suggestions), looking up config fields from the installed libraries instead of model memory, searching or reading vendored Guard docs, checking a payload against guard-core's real detection engine, setting up any Guard engine, adapter or telemetry agent across Go, TypeScript, PHP, Rust and Python, or deciding whether answers reflect the installed versions versus the bundled docs snapshot. Also use when adding a covered Guard package to PACKAGE_MODELS, updating the ecosystem registry in ecosystem.py, extending the tool layer, or debugging why introspection reports missing libraries (isolated uvx environments have nothing to introspect).

# Guard Core MCP

MCP server for the Guard ecosystem: config validation, config-field lookup, docs search, live threat detection, and ecosystem-wide setup guidance, answered from the libraries actually installed in the interpreter running it (not from model memory). Import package is `guard_core_mcp`; console script is `guard-core-mcp`. Current as of guard-core-mcp 1.1.0.

## Quick Reference

* Install into the project whose Guard libraries you want introspected: `uv add --dev guard-core-mcp`; register with `claude mcp add guard-core -- uv run guard-core-mcp`.
* `uvx guard-core-mcp` starts but can only answer from bundled docs and the ecosystem registry; an isolated environment has nothing to introspect.
* Two answer sources: live introspection (installed models + real detection engine) vs the vendored docs snapshot; `versions` reports both (`installed` vs `docs_bundled_for`, plus `knowledge_bundled_for` for the hand-written corpus) so you can detect skew before trusting a docs answer.
* Tools return error dicts (they do not raise); `ModuleNotFoundError` becomes a `{"error", "hint"}` dict naming the missing library.
* `check_payload` runs the detection stage only, not the whole middleware pipeline; `enable_redis` is forced off.
* `ecosystem`, `adapter_setup` and `wire_agent` are pure data from `ecosystem.py` and work without any Guard library installed.

## Installation

```bash
uv add --dev guard-core-mcp      # or: pip install guard-core-mcp
```

Install it in the same environment as `guard-core` / `fastapi-guard` / `guard-agent` so introspection sees the versions you actually ship. Requires `mcp>=2` (a hard pin; the server imports `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`, which does not exist in mcp 1.x).

## Setup

```bash
claude mcp add guard-core -- uv run guard-core-mcp
```

The server speaks MCP over stdio (`guard_core_mcp.server:main`). To verify what it will answer from, call the `versions` tool first: it reports the installed Guard package versions and the version the vendored docs were synced from. If they disagree, trust introspection for config/detection questions and treat docs answers as version-skewed.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `versions` | `installed` vs `docs_bundled_for` vs `knowledge_bundled_for` versions, per covered package |
| `validate_config` | Validates a config dict against the installed Pydantic model; reports unknown keys with `difflib` suggestions (pydantic silently drops them) and captures `DeprecationWarning`s (one type error does not hide warnings for the remaining valid fields) |
| `config_fields` | Field lookup over the installed model schema (`query`, `package="fastapi-guard"`) |
| `search_docs` | Naive per-line token-count search over the vendored corpus and the hand-written knowledge corpus (no index) |
| `get_doc` | Returns a vendored doc or knowledge entry by package + path; traversal-guarded via `resolve()` + `is_relative_to` |
| `check_payload` | Runs guard-core's real detection engine on a payload through `_SyntheticRequest` (a structural `GuardRequest` implementation) |
| `ecosystem` | Full registry matrix: 5 languages (python, go, typescript, php, rust), each with engine, 4 adapters, agent; plus spec-4.0.3 conformance facts and the guard-core-app ingestion contract |
| `adapter_setup` | `adapter_setup(language, framework)`: install + verified quick-start snippet for one adapter, with its engine's install and conformance status; accepts the framework slug or the package name |
| `wire_agent` | `wire_agent(language, framework=None)`: agent install, snippet, buffer/flush/overflow/retry semantics, the ingestion contract (headers, `v1=` HMAC over the uncompressed body, 262144-byte limit, 200/429/413/400/404/422 semantics), and a per-adapter integration note |

## Covered Libraries

`PACKAGE_MODELS` in `config.py` maps package name to `(import module, model class)`: `guard-core` to `guard_core.SecurityConfig`, `fastapi-guard` to `guard.SecurityConfig`, `guard-agent` to `guard_agent.AgentConfig`. Adding a package means adding an allowlist entry; the `importlib.import_module` call is safe only because it is constrained to that dict.

The rest of the family lives in `ecosystem.py` as typed data: engines (`guard-core-go` tagged v0.1.0, `@guardcore/core` tagged 1.0.0, `guard-core-php` tagged v0.1.0, `guard-core-rs` untagged 0.0.1), twenty adapters with snippets copied verbatim from their READMEs, the five agents, and the SaaS contract. Facts are verified against the sibling repos; update by hand when they move. The vendored docs come from sibling clones (`../fastapi-guard`, `../guard-core`, `../guard-agent`, `../guard-core-ts`) via `scripts/sync_docs.py` (`make sync-docs`); regenerate after upstream releases, never hand-edit `guard_core_mcp/_docs/`. The `_knowledge/` corpus is the hand-written counterpart (Go/PHP/Rust engines and agents, and the SaaS ingestion contract), one `index.md` per repo plus a manifest; edit those directly.

## Footguns

* **Isolated environments break introspection.** `uvx guard-core-mcp` (or any env without the Guard libraries installed) silently degrades to docs-only answers for config/detection questions; use `versions` to detect it, and install the server as a dev dependency of the project instead. The `ecosystem`, `adapter_setup` and `wire_agent` tools are unaffected: they are static data.
* **Do not trust docs answers across versions.** The vendored snapshot is pinned to the last `make sync-docs` run; upstream releases independently. Check `versions` first.
* **`check_payload` is detection-only.** It runs the detection engine, not rate limiting, IP rules, or the middleware pipeline; a clean result is not "this request would pass".
* **`validate_config` is the only unknown-key detector.** Pydantic silently drops unknown fields, so a typo'd config validates clean unless you run it through this tool.
* **`mcp` must stay >= 2.** A `uv lock --upgrade` that downgrades mcp breaks the server at import; semgrep is pinned separately and runs via `uvx --from semgrep`.
* **Never hand-edit `guard_core_mcp/_docs/`.** It is generated output; the drift check (`make check-docs-drift`) and CI's weekly job will flag your edits. `guard_core_mcp/_knowledge/` is the opposite: hand-written, edit it directly.
* **Registry facts age.** `ecosystem.py` pins versions, tags and README snippets from the sibling repos at build time; untagged packages move fast. When an answer says `release_status: untagged`, re-check the repo before pinning anything.
